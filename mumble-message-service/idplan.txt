FE:make a uuid when msg has to be sent. Send the msg along with it's uuid.
Gateway accepts, posts it on the queue, send it along with the uuid.
After msging service saves it, it will post it back on another queue along with the actual msg id and uuid.

FE will receive it, (now here you can have the acknowledgement that the msg has been sent).
Take the uuid, update the status on the msg (originally what I wanted to do was change the key entirely on
that particular msg, from it's key being a uuid to being the msg id, maybe it will regenerate the component entirely,
cause of React's relationship with keys)

Now for delivered acknowledgements, I can have the frontend send an ack with the msgId when it receives 
a msg with a to field equal to the user's userId
